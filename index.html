        <h2 class="h2-padding">Full stack web developer from Atlanta, GA</h2>
        <p>My name is Amelia, and my lifelong interest in science and tech
            lead me to pursue a career in web development. I have a Bachelor's of
            Science degree in Biology from Furman University. After a few years working
            in the healthcare industry, I decided my passion for problem solving and helping others needed a more
            creative, innovative outlet.
        </p>
        <p>
            My web development career officially began at the Atlanta DigitalCrafts
            Full Stack Immersive 16 week program, where I became well-versed in Python and Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not helping build the web, I am pianist with my own small piano
            teaching business. I've found that my passion in creating web applications
            and teaching piano to young musicians coincide harmoniously.

            <p class="bio">PhotoSpotter is an interactive Web App that gives users the power to recreate their favorite pictures by giving them the location, 
                time and camera information of the image, as well as local weather. The user can input the subject they would like to photograph    
                and instantly be transported to a gallery of their specified interest. With one click of an image, the user will immediately receive    
                all the necessary information to create a similar photo.

                A "social lending" site. Users can list any items they have that they are willing to lend. Friends, family, and neighbors can connect and can
                search to see if someone has something they need, from a book to a power tool. People can request to borrow and, if accepted, then there is a 
                record of who has the item, a field where the borrower puts how long they need it, another where the lender can put when they need it back, and 
                the app can send reminders of the "due date."
