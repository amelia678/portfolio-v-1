        <p>My name is Amelia, and my lifelong interest in science and tech
            lead me to pursue a career in web development. I have a Bachelor's of
            Science degree in Biology from Furman University. After a few years working
            in the healthcare industry, I decided my passion for problem solving needed a more
            creative, innovative outlet.
        </p>
        <p>
            My web development career officially began at the Atlanta DigitalCrafts
            Full Stack Immersive 16 week program, where I became well-versed in Python and Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not helping build the web, I am pianist with my own small piano
            teaching business. I've found that my passion in creating web applications
            and teaching piano to young musicians coincide harmoniously.
